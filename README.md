##Resources

The two jQuery plugins I used for my resume project were the ScrollUp feature and the Cycle2 slideshow. 

- [ScrollUp](https://markgoodyear.com/labs/scrollup/?theme=tab)

The ScrollUp feature was used in my project as a way for my viewers to easily navigate their way back to the top of my page. This is especially handy for the mobile view, which ends up being a really long page. All the user has to do to interact with it is to click on the button. From there, he or she will be guided smoothly to the top of the page. The button can be found on the bottom right corner of the page.

- [Cycle2](http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/)

In place of a static headshot image, I chose to use the Cycle2 slideshow to highlight some interesting things I've done. I thought this was a neat feature that allows the user to see me in a more personal light. The slideshow can be found on the top of the page, just beneath the logo. The user does not have to do anything to interact with it, as it changes images by itself.

Other than the plugins, I did not use any resources outside of the lectures and my notes on this assignment.

##Comments

This was a fun assignment, as I was able to recreate my static resume design in a more dynamic, web friendly way. I enjoyed how it included many of the things we have learned this semester.

My custom jQuery code can be found on all the h2s in my project. When you enter the mouse into the element, it changes all of the h2s to a green color. When the mouse exits the element, the h2s change back to the red. 

I did use a fixed height in my project. I used it for the social media icons. The only reason why I did this was because the Facebook icon is naturally taller than the other icons, so I found the fixed height was the best way to ensure they were all the same height. Additionally, the size of the icons to not change throughout the screen sizes.
